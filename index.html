  <h3 class="h2 post-title">Electroneum - First Impressions </h3>
  <p class="post-summary">A coworker recently sent me a link to Yet Another Cryptocurrency. Like most people, I&rsquo;m pretty burnt out with all these new coins and ICO&rsquo;s popping up each week. In fact, I get about 5-10 ICO spam emails in my Junk mail folder.
This one looked to be just a little different, though. He was excited because this one allows you to use your phone to mine. I talked to him about how it&rsquo;s a neat idea, but ultimately probably won&rsquo;t be profitable, especially compare to a multi-GPU setup.</p>

  <h3 class="h2 post-title">Moving ZFS datasets between volumes </h3>
  <p class="post-summary">If you run ZFS like I do (and I think you should) there will probably come at time when you need to migrate a dataset from one volume to another. This was done in FreeNAS (FreeBSD), but the steps should apply to any *nix system with ZFS
The great thing about ZFS is that we can do most of this migration with our services and everything still running.
We&rsquo;ll start by taking a snapshot of the dataset we want to move.</p>

  <h3 class="h2 post-title">Why I switched from Android to iOS </h3>
  <p class="post-summary">Note: This article is not just a stringent comparison of Apple vs Android, but a look at the whole picture that I took while deciding which phone to switch to.
A few months ago, my beloved Verizon HTC One M8 began to lose it’s charge at an alarming rate. It would be at 40% battery by lunch time after a day of very moderate use. Luckily, I was due for an upgrade from Verizon.</p>

  <h3 class="h2 post-title">Allow a Chromecast through a WatchGuard firewall </h3>
  <p class="post-summary">Background I recently picked up a Chromecast for my TV so I could stream Netflix easier since XBMC’s addon is terrible if you don’t want to use a keyboard. It was super easy to setup, but after it updated and connected to my WiFi I couldn’t see it from my phone. I did some digging and found that my WatchGuard 25W was the culprit. After I added an any-any rule I was able to see it, but that left it wide-open on my network.</p>

  <h3 class="h2 post-title">Fix “Some settings are managed by your system administrator” in Windows 7 </h3>
  <p class="post-summary">Background A few months back, I was doing cleanup on a system that I had cleaned of malware. Whatever junk was on there had configured a local proxy server to run, but Malwarebytes had ripped it out. The system unfortunately still thought it was supposed to use the proxy server that doesn’t exist; consequently, I had no internet access. That’s an easy enough fix, right? I open Internet Options and change the LAN settings to not use a proxy and close it.</p>

  <h3 class="h2 post-title">Change Network Location in Windows 8.1/2012 R2 from Powershell </h3>
  <p class="post-summary">Step 1 From an elevated PowerShell window issue the following command to gather some information about our current network profile:
" Get-NetConnectionProfile Name : Unidentified Network InterfaceAlias : Ethernet InterfaceIndex : 10 NetworkCategory : Public IPv4Connectivity : LocalNetwork IPv6Connectivity : LocalNetwork  The only information we really need from this output is the “InterfaceIndex”
Step 2 After getting the InterfaceIndex, we run the following command:
&rdquo;&gt; Set-NetConnectionProfile -InterfaceIndex 10 -NetworkCategory Private  The last argument is what category you want to switch it to.</p>

  <h3 class="h2 post-title">Fix HAXM Emulation Error in Android Studio </h3>
  <p class="post-summary">Requirement Note: Android Studio requires an Intel processor with VT-X support for it’s built-in emulators to work. If you want to do Android development with emulators on an AMD processor, I would highly suggest using Genymotion. If you’re not sure if your Intel processor supports VT-X, Intel has an article here.
This error is occurring because Android Studio requires Intel Hardware Accelerated Execution Manager (Intel HAXM) to run it’s emulators.</p>
